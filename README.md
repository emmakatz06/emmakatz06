👋 Hi, I'm Emma!  

🎓 A sophomore at **Brooklyn College**, pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Science and Psychology**  
🔭 Aspiring Software Engineer, Game Developer, and Mental Health Technology Enthusiast  

I’m passionate about creating programs and games that support **mental health and well-being**. By combining creativity, psychology, and computer science, I hope to design programs that make a real difference for people struggling with mental health problems. Currently, I’m focusing on building my fall studio AI project as part of my Break Through Tech fellowship to strengthen my technical and team skills.
